# Welcome to MineKoloft

I'm just trying to remake a simple web version of minecraft with ThreeJS!
here's a demo of how it looks right now

Demo: https://minekoloft.netlify.app/

## How to play?

It has 5 types of blocks which you can switch between with 1-5 on keyboard.
Use alt-delete to remove the blocks. but placing the block is the same as minecraft

## Want to extend, develop modify?

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install && npm start`

It basically installs the dependencies and runs the app in the dev mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload automatically if you make edits.<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
